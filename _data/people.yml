    On any given day, Jennifer may be found leading an engineering team through
    a challenging project, coaxing a developer through learning new skills or
    navigating new experiences, or facilitating workshops that help a team blend
    their technical challenges with their organizational objectives.  After
    receiving her degree in computer science from MIT, Jennifer's work spanned
    infrastructure and operations, and good ol' feature delivery.  The
    combination of her technical experience, interpersonal depth, near infinite
    patience, and nose for nuance creates the ideal management and technical
    coach (who is still happy to sit down and hammer out code).

    Betsy is most at home wading into a codebase and uncovering and distilling
    the intentions at play. She has a keen eye for separating the underlying
    domain concepts from the details, and a talent for helping teams deliver
    value without over-engineering.  Thanks to an earlier career in theater,
    Betsy brings to the tech industry a deep background in creating usefulness
    while delivering projects with hard deadlines.
