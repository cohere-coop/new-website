# new-website
Temporary repo to iterate on website revamp without touching the existing www.cohere.coop configuration

Jekyll-based GitHub Pages-hosted static website.

The Jekyll source is in `docs/` directory. (GitHub pages [only supports either `/` or `docs/` directories](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23073).)

Run locally:
```bash
$ cd docs && bundle exec jekyll serve
```
