Years spent both writing software and leading those efforts have led us separately to the same place:
software is delivered best by high-functioning teams.
Cohere was created to bring that out for your team.

We offer:
* Executive coaching to support you as you change your organization
* Career coaching to support you as you change yourself
* Technical coaching to level up your report's (or your!) software delivery capability
* One-off workshop facilitation to bring your team together
* Team coaching to level up your team together

Questions our clients asked before working with us to find the answers:
* [Am I making the right hire? how do I know if I'm making the right choice?](/interviewer-skills-for-engineers-and-hiring-managers)
* [How do I change my organization? how do I train my devs to prioritize shipping, so they write good code instead of the best possible code?](/technical-coaching)
* [How do I change how I work in my organization? how can I better achieve my career and job goals?](/coaching)

If you've ever wished you had...
* A trusted, experienced engineering leader you could talk with about your strategic organizational ideas
* Another senior engineer to mentor an engineer or team for a few hours a week
* That second rephrasing of your perspective that causes your team to finally align under your vision
