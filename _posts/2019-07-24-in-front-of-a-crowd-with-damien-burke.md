<p>Storytime With Managers is a collection of twenty minute conversations where Jennifer Tu finds answers to questions of interest for both established and budding leaders in technology fields.</p>

<p>If you haven't experienced this already, someday you will.  At some point in your career, you'll find yourself in front of a crowd.  Maybe you'll be explaining your architectural vision for the next sprint, or maybe you'll be sharing the team reorg plan. Whatever it is, what can you do to influence the crowd?</p>

<p>Today's episode is with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/exmember">Damien Burke</a>; an engineer, actor, poker player, and hypnotherapist.  We talk about his experience acting as MC for a small conference, and Damien shares he created a warm, welcoming space that pulled strangers together into a community.</p>
