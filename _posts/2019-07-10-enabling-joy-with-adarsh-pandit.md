Storytime With Managers is a collection of twenty minute conversations where Jennifer Tu finds answers to questions of interest for both established and budding leaders in technology fields.

I thought today's episode would be about leading when you don't have full authority, and it was -- but it was also a conversation about building trust.  <a href="https://www.twitter.com/adarshp">Adarsh Pandit</a> explains his mission of enabling joy on any team he works with, and how building trust allows him to do that.

Adarsh shares some of his techniques for building trust, for recovering when things go off the tracks, and for countering social anxiety.
