Despite millions of dollars in investment by companies such as Google and
Facebook the needle of diversity in Silicon Valley has barely shifted. Ellen
Pao's recent article in the New York Times [evaluating if anything has
changed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/16/opinion/sunday/ellen-pao-sexism-tech.html?mcubz=1)
concludes there&rsquo;s _potential_ for change, but not much _actual_ change:

> Five years from now, if enough people speak up for others, the answer
> to &ldquo;Has anything changed?&rdquo; has the potential to be an unequivocal
> yes. <cite>&mdash; Ellen Pao</cite>

It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in hand-wringing and pearl-clutching about the
latest racist and/or sexist tech fiasco. It appeases a sense of morality while
avoiding the work of addressing our own biases and behaviors that reinforce
patriarchal white supremacy. That's not to say we shouldn&rsquo;t be outraged
that people of color earn significantly less than white colleagues or that
_{tech-cxo-a}_ just did _{horrible-action-b}_ and still made
_{obscene-dollar-amount-c}_.

A nuanced understanding of privilege, both ours and others', focuses energy on
our own behaviors and beliefs first. Once we have a handle on those, we can
channel that energy outwards to our direct sphere of influence. Change comes
from within, and equity in tech&rsquo;s funding, employment and compensation
landscape is a big change.

### Understanding Privilege

Privileges, simply put, provide _safety from harm_ and _increased
opportunities._ Conversely, someone who has increased vulnerability to harm or
decreased opportunities could be considered _underprivileged_. Privileges may be
acquired innately, earned, granted, imposed, or through other means.

An _innate privilege_ could be a genetic predisposition to heart health. An
_earned advantage_, such as excelling in school and collecting a strong professional network, is something to be proud of.
_Granted privileges_, like knowing someone else will make sure you have food and shelter while you launch a business, are an incredible blessing.
_Imposed privileges_ are a kind of granted privilege that perhaps you're not
comfortable with, such as if your pay is higher due to your ethnicity or gender
presentation.

When introspecting on privilege it can be useful to think along several axes:

- Physical and Mental Health
- Relational and Social Integration
- Occupational Flexibility and Stability
- Financial Stability and Leverage
- Citizenship and Backing Documentation

You can visualize the interplay of these aspects of privilege [like
waves](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-3/Interference-of-Waves).
They're complex and complicated yet predictable interactions that shape our interactions with the world.

Like waves, privileges may interact constructively. Someone with a strong
financial safety net may likely wind up with a better education due to not
feeling the pressure of needing to work full time to pay their way through
school. They may also interact destructively. Neurologically atypical students
often receive a lower quality education in school systems not designed to
support their needs.

These interactions feed into themselves, compounding or reducing one's privilege
in current and future contexts. Reduced privileges may sometimes be mitigated by
simple strategies rooted in understanding the struggles and needs of the
underprivileged demographic. Whirpool found that [supplying schools with washers and
dryers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whirlpool-installs-washer-dryers-schools-poor-poverty-kids-raises-attendance_us_57b1dbe0e4b07184041200be)
improved attendance for financially underprivileged students.

I mentally visualize my (and others') privileges as a graph or matrix.
Interconnected, nuanced and unique. When confronted with a privilege gap it's easy to leap to stereotypes or media projections of people. When I'm struggling to understand someone else's decision making or behavior I try to mentally overlay my understanding of our relative privilege. Mentally overlaying our
relative privilege both slows down my judge-y tendencies and helps
humanize others.

### Owning Your Privilege

When thinking about our own privilege, it is helpful to anchor our baseline
on others' lack of advantages. This helps us avoid the trap of thinking we have
nothing to offer because others have more than us, as well as helps us build
empathy for those who have less privilege.

Developing a realistic understanding of the advantages, power and influence we
have can be uncomfortable. Imposed privileges are especially difficult. Perhaps
that interview for my first job was because my parents knew the owner. Maybe I
can laugh about the times I got pulled over because police rarely escalate when
stopping a well dressed white person. These advantages can be a source of guilt
and shame, _or we can choose to acknowledge, understand and work to mitigate the
struggles of those who don't have the same advantages._

### Leveraging Your Privilege

There are many ways someone in a position of leadership may leverage their
privilege to improve the equity of the tech sector. Here are a few I strive for.

1. _Read books_. Books by authors who don't share your privilege graph are a
   great way to gain outside perspective. [bell
   hooks](http://www.bellhooksinstitute.com/)'s [Feminism is for
   Everybody](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168484.Feminism_is_for_Everybody)
   is a great introduction. I like to balance my harder reading with fiction, as
   that's a great way to see a world from the perspective of someone else.
   [Octavia Butler](http://octaviabutler.org/), [N.K.
   Jemisin](http://nkjemisin.com/) and [Nnedi Okorafor](http://nnedi.com/) are
   all incredible authors who blend real talk and powerful, engaging stories.
1. _Don't inflict help_. As problem solvers, engineers have a tendency to rush in
   and &ldquo;fix&rdquo; things. Instead of offering advice or trying to solve
   someone else's problem, do this instead: observe, listen and learn. Despite
   spending the last ~5 years of my life trying to understand how privilege
   impacts my and others' opportunities and vulnerability my instincts are still
   very often wrong.
1. _Center the needs and desires of those you are trying to support_. It's easy
   to project your desires onto someone else. Make sure you truly understand
   other people's needs and desires when trying to support them individually. Be
   mindful of [tokenization](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tokenism) and
   stereotypes, and avoid using them to guide your actions and beliefs.
1. _Get positive consent every step of the way_. Privilege has a huge impact on
   what works, even in similar situations. Ask permission before making a
   suggestion. Instead of offering solutions they would need to act on, offer
   suggestions for what you can do to help. Be ready to adjust or back away
   completely based on the response.
1. _Focus on sponsorship and the environment_. Oftentimes this involves
   advocating for responsibility or compensation improvements for people who
   would be punished for standing up for themselves. Provide resources and make
   space for people with a different privilege graph to shine. Then get out of
   their way and stand by and behind them.
1. _Apologize early and often_. Everyone makes mistakes. Owning mistakes and
   any harm caused sets a good example for others on how to make an environment
   more inclusive. Further, doubling down or ignoring our own harmful behaviors
   or actions can cause even more harm than the initial error. That said,
   _demanding forgiveness_ or over-apologizing centers yourself, as opposed to
   the harm you caused others.

Detoxing tech is our responsibility. A 2012 research study by Catalyst
demonstrated that [people in leadership, especially white men in leadership, who
train in inclusive leadership practices increase behaviors critical for building
inclusive relationships and teams, as well as a decrease in general workplace
incivility](http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/calling-all-white-men-can-training-help-create-inclusive-workplaces).

That said, we don't have to do it alone. Look to people of color and members of
underrepresented groups for leadership and follow their lead. Move beyond the
pipeline and pay for help learning how to detox your workplace.

If you're looking to make broad organizational changes, work with experts like
Nicole Sanchez of [Vaya Consulting](https://www.vayaconsulting.com/), Valerie
Aurora from [Frame Shift Consulting](https://frameshiftconsulting.com/) or [Ashe
Dryden](https://www.ashedryden.com/).

For those with less organizational influence or financial power, consider
investing in a workshop or coaching from a professional who understands your goals of a more equitable organization. [Jennifer Tu](/who-we-are#jennifer-tu), for instance, is exceptional at helping teams and leaders learn how to identify and change behaviors that impact members of underrepresented groups.

There are also opportunities for individual contributors and others without
institutional authority. Invest in building your professional network to include
people from underrepresented groups. Identify, follow and learn from leaders
with a different privilege graph in your field. Buy [books](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897) and take training on being supportive. Provide opportunity scholarships or [fund
organizations](http://joinfundclub.com/) led by members of underrepresented
groups.

This requires investing your time, attention and finances. It isn&rsquo;t
enough to acknowledge the problem anymore. It&rsquo;s time to do something.
