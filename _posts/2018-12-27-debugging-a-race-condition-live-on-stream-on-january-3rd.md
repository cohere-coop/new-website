A few weeks ago, we asked the [dev.to](https://dev.to/cohere/what-rails-or-js-programming-problems-do-you-wish-you-could-watch-someone-work-out-51pl) and broader programming community [what programming problems they would like watch being solved on stream in a real-world context](https://twitter.com/zspencer/status/1074724243235950592). ~40% of you wanted to see us solve a _race condition_ and another 30% wanted to see us solve a _brittle JavaScript feature test_.

Seeing as Betsy and I are both "yes, and" kind of people (and there happened to be a really good representation of this in one of our [technical coaching clients](/products/technical-coaching/?utm_campaign=debugging-race-condition-livestream&utm_content=announce-link) codebases) we figured we could show a race condition in a brittle JavaScript feature test!

If you have:
*   Struggled to figure out when, exactly, test data setup is being completed
*   Been baffled by an `undefined` or `null` value while chaining Promises
*   Deleted an end-to-end, browser feature test because "I can show the feature working when I do it, but the browser test is failing!"

Then [RSVP to attend our free live-stream on January 3rd from 10 AM PT/1PM ET to 11 AM PT/2PM ET where we will step through diagnosing, debugging, and resolving a race condition in a brittle cypress feature test](/events/january-3rd-2019-livestream-of-debugging-a-race-condition-in-a-cypress-browser-test/?utm_campaign=debugging-race-condition-livestream&utm_content=main-cta)!

We're both pretty new to the streaming thing and want to limit our exposure to embarrassment; so [we're requiring people to RSVP](/events/january-3rd-2019-livestream-of-debugging-a-race-condition-in-a-cypress-browser-test/?utm_campaign=debugging-race-condition-livestream&utm_content=requiring-rsvp-attend-link). Attendees will be sent an email a few minutes before the stream starts with a link to join.

We're hoping to record the screen, audio, and video stream for later, butâ€¦ again.. We're new to streaming video. So no promises.

We'll be monitoring the [#RealWorldCode](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23realworldcode) and [#UntanglingJS](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23UntanglingJS) hashtags on Twitter before, throughout and after the stream and would love to hear your questions, thoughts, and insights!
