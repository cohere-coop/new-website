Pair programming! As polarizing a topic as the _Editor Wars_. People love or hate pairing, and for good reason! It's a tough skill with benefits that aren't always immediately clear. It can be frustrating, feel slow, and even be a source of uncomfortable interpersonal conflict.

That said, pairing was designed to solve a _particular problem_, best described using the [Facts, Operations and Goals](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/grist-for-the-mill/) model of knowledge work. Almost any problem that emerges when building software can be described as gaps in understanding or alignment on the facts, operations, and goals of the work. These gaps are the FOG of software development.

You've experienced the FOG before. A project blows through the estimated timebox but the executive team wasn't informed of this Fact in a useful manner. We built a feature thinking the end user wanted to reach _this_ objective but really, they wanted _that_ objective, which after being interpretted through our personal lens; resulted in a feature that doesn't get used enough to justify the expense.

Pairing (and to a larger extent, mob programing), is the best way to illuminate a path through the FOG. The closer we work with someone else, the more we actively expose our decision making, and more frequently we create opportunities for others to re-align our understanding of the facts, operations, and goals of our work; the greater the probability we avoid falling off a (metaphorical, hopefully!) cliff.

Now, being tossed into a room, told "Go pair! It'll make you more efficient" and then left to your own devices isn't exactly the _ideal_ learning experience. The benefits of pair programming are directly related to both how skilled people areas well as how conducive the environment they are in is to pairing.
