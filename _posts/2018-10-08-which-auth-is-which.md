    Ever get flustered talking about security? Wish you had a slightly clearer mental model when talking about whose
    who and what they can do?
  </p>

  <p>
    We've lovingly illustrated a zine that details the difference between <strong><em>authentication</em></strong> and
    <strong><em>authorization</em></strong>, giving you and your team a consistent vocabulary for talking about
    permissions.

  This zine quickly and clearly walks you through the answers to all your initial questions about "auth".

<ul>
  <li>What's the difference between <em>authentication</em> and <em>authorization</em>?</li>
  <li>Can they be used interchangeably?</li>
  <li>How do I remember which is which, or know which one I'm using?</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll want to leave a printed copy on your desk to refer to quickly for future refreshers!</p>
